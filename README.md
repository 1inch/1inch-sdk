# Developer Portal SDKs

This repo will host a collection of open source SDKs used to access the Developer Portal APIs. 

## Overview

The [Developer Portal](https://portal.1inch.dev/) is a hub for accessing all 1inch APIs. These APIs include our Swap Aggregator, Limit Order Protocol, 1inch Fusion, and [many more](https://portal.1inch.dev/documentation).

To get started, follow these steps:

- Make an account at the main [Developer Portal Webiste](https://portal.1inch.dev/)
- Explore the [API docs](https://portal.1inch.dev/documentation)
- Try the [GoLang SDK](https://github.com/1inch/1inch-sdk/tree/main/golang) to simplify the integration of the Developer Portal directly into your backend. 

The SDK suite will expand to cover more than just GoLang over time.

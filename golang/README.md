Dev Portal GoLang SDK

## Running locally

// TODO Decide on a pattern for pulling/committing to a type definition

Currently, the type definitions are not saved to the repo. These definitions will be set once a release is made which will lock the version of the SDK with the current versions of the various 1inch APIs. 

Before running this locally, you must first generate the most up-to-date types files using the `generate_types.sh` script.

Dev Portal GoLang SDK

## Running locally

Before using the SDK, you must set your Dev Portal API key as an environment variable:

```bash
export DEV_PORTAL_TOKEN=<api_token>
```

**note**: if you are running the SDK from an IDE like Intellij, you may need to set the environment variable in the IDE's dedicated run config instead
